<h1 id="the-bro-code">The Bro Code</h1>
<h2 id="only-give-attention-to-your-girl">Only give attention to your
girl</h2>
<p>Bros should only give attention to their girl. Other girls should get
their attention from their man.</p>
<p>Bros who violate this rule should be shamed and humiliated in
proportion to the level and frequency of the transgression.</p>
<h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
<p>It upsets the relationship market because <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26oepYGK5k">women are reinforced
primarily by attention</a>. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>men should give attention to their woman to reinforce the
relationship</li>
<li>men should not give attention to other woman to not deprive them of
the need for a real relationship (i.e, like competitive inhibition,
because the woman’s need for this relationship resource is satiated by
non-relationship attention).</li>
<li>It is up to men to action this since women are not incentivised to
reduce their attention.</li>
<li>To have impact it is necessary for a critical mass of men to be on
board with this, hence the need to admonish and educate other bros as
necessary.</li>
<li>Don’t be a simp.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-not-sideline-a-single-bro">Do not sideline a single bro</h2>
<p>In a social mingling situation, a single bro probably wants to
interact with the girls. Do not distract said bro with unnecessary small
talk unless you are a single girl he’s interested in.</p>
