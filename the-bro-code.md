# The Bro Code

## Only give attention to your girl

Bros should only give attention to their girl. Other girls should get their attention from their man.

Bros who violate this rule should be shamed and humiliated in proportion to the level and frequency of the transgression.

### Reasoning
It upsets the relationship market because [women are reinforced primarily by attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26oepYGK5k). So:
- men should give attention to their woman to reinforce the relationship
- men should not give attention to other woman to not deprive them of the need for a real relationship (i.e, like competitive inhibition, because the woman's need for this relationship resource is satiated by non-relationship attention).
- It is up to men to action this since women are not incentivised to reduce their attention.
- To have impact it is necessary for a critical mass of men to be on board with this, hence the need to admonish and educate other bros as necessary.
